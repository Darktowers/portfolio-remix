1. Module Pattern: This pattern allows you to encapsulate private and public properties and methods within a single module. This helps to keep your code organized and modular.

1. Singleton Pattern: This pattern ensures that only one instance of an object is created and provides a global point of access to that object. It can be useful when you need to limit the number of instances of an object in your application.

1. Factory Pattern: This pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It can be useful when you have multiple similar objects that need to be created in different ways.

1. Observer Pattern: This pattern allows you to create a relationship between objects where if one object changes state, all dependent objects are notified and updated automatically. It can be useful in situations where you need to keep multiple parts of your application in sync with each other.

1. Decorator Pattern: This pattern allows you to add behavior or functionality to an object at runtime without affecting the behavior of other objects in the same class. It can be useful when you need to add new features to an existing object without modifying the existing code.

1. MV* Patterns: Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-Presenter (MVP), and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) are all patterns that help to organize the code in a web application. These patterns separate the code into distinct parts, making it easier to maintain and modify the code over time.

1. Prototype Pattern: This pattern allows you to create new objects based on an existing object, rather than creating a new object from scratch. This can be useful when you have objects with a lot of shared functionality.

1. Promises Pattern: This pattern provides a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It allows you to chain together a series of asynchronous operations and handle errors in a more readable way than using nested callbacks.
