1. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): This principle emphasizes the importance of avoiding code duplication by factoring out common functionality into reusable functions or modules. It helps to reduce the amount of code you need to maintain and improves code readability.

1. Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS): This principle emphasizes the importance of keeping code simple and easy to understand. It helps to reduce complexity and makes it easier to maintain the code over time.

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. It helps to keep your code modular and easier to maintain, since changes to one part of the code won't affect other parts.

1. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): This principle states that classes or modules should be open for extension but closed for modification. It helps to keep your code flexible and easy to modify without affecting existing functionality.

1. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that higher-level modules should not depend on lower-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. It helps to decouple your code and make it easier to modify without affecting other parts of the code.

1. Composition Over Inheritance: This principle states that you should favor composition over inheritance when designing your code. It helps to reduce complexity and improve code flexibility, since objects can be composed of smaller, reusable objects rather than relying on inheritance hierarchies.

1. Keep functions small and focused: This principle emphasizes the importance of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more focused functions. It helps to improve code readability and makes it easier to debug and maintain the code.

1. Use meaningful names: This principle emphasizes the importance of using clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. It helps to improve code readability and makes it easier to understand the purpose of different parts of the code.
